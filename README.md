# Embedded_Systems_Programming

#### This project is to show my works on embedded system programming . This course was offered by Mr Silvere and sponsored by adorsys and Clemios sarl. The programming on embedded systems was by the used of tools like eclipse and programming langauges like C.

The microcontroller used was the arm architeture controller(STM32)
I also learned how to read the datasheet and user manaul of both the board and he micro-controller

How to configure the pins of a micro-controller as input output alternate function or analog signals.

How to activate  clocks for every thing you want to configure that has it own timer that need to be started before it can function.

#### A big thanks to them who made it possible for me to get here . In this repo you are going to find things like:

-  Blinking an LED using registers in C
-  Blinking 3 LED using registers in C
-  BLinking three LED at  a particular frequency using Delays and timers which is more efficient than delays.
-   Using libopencm3 to do the above tasks.
-   using timers to configure PWM(pulse width Modulation) by calculating and counfiguring the duty cycle which detates the amout of time for which  an LED needs to stay up before slowing down and analysing the out put using an Oscilloscope

-   Configure microcontroller pins as input , alternate functions, output or anolag pina

-   Configuring and handling external interrupts . By defining what it means by an interupt to occur.

-   Configuring ADC to convert the anolog signal from the room into values that con be displayed on the screen . This is done by using the interal sensor on the motherboard.

-   Configure DAC to send analog waves from digital input and the result is monitored using an Oscilloscope

> Some of the above task where given as exercises.
